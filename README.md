Donation Website - Bringing Generosity to Life
Overview
This project is a full-stack donation platform designed to connect donors and receivers seamlessly. It aims to make donations accessible, inclusive, and impactful. The platform supports both direct donations (such as blood, organs, and clothes) and indirect donations (like financial aid, food, and educational supplies). It also incorporates AI-powered matching algorithms, voice assistance, and reward systems to encourage participation and simplify the donation process for everyone, including less tech-savvy users.
